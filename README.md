# NLP Assignments: POS Tagging and Pretrained Language Models

This repository contains my implementations for two key assignments in Natural Language Processing (NLP): Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging using Neural Networks and exploring Pretrained Language Models.

## Assignment 1: Neural Networks for POS Tagging

This assignment focuses on building and experimenting with neural networks for POS tagging of English tweets. The approach involves using a feed-forward neural network that predicts the POS tag of a word token given its context. 

### Data

- Training, development, and devtest sets of annotated English tweets.
- Word embeddings from the skip-gram model trained on English tweets.

### Model Architecture

- A feed-forward neural network with word embeddings and context window.
- Experimentation with different context window sizes and feature engineering.
